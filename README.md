# Redesigning AZ Lyrics

AZ lyrics is arguably one of the least usable and aesthetically pleasing sites out there, so for our project, we were given the task of redesigning the 4 views of this site - the Home page, Search page, Lyrics page, and Artist page. We felt that since music is constantly evolving, a music-related site should, in turn, be up-to-date with its contents. My teammates (George Geng and Jennifer Jia) and I wanted to give the site a trendy, modern feel that incorporated relevant UI and UX practices. Feel free to play around with it!
